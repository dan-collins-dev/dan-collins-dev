# Dan Collins

- 💻 I'm a hobbyist game developer for a little over two years.
- 📖 I'm currently learning web development to transition into a new career
- 🎮 Gaming has been a huge part of my life, although the time spent playing games has now turned into making games.
- 🌳 When I'm not working on a problem at my desk, I love to be outside.
- ⛵ There's nothing better than casually kayaking on a lake all to yourself ❤️
