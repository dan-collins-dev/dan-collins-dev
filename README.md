# Dan Collins
I'm not a programmer. I'm a *problem solver*. I just happen to solve problems with code. 

I am currently interested in becoming a full-stack web developer. I started with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, but I'm exploring different frameworks and languages as well.

### Completed Projects
[Highest of the High](https://github.com/dan-collins-dev/highest-of-the-hi)

A mock service that allow game developers to register their games and receive an ID for their game. They will use that to make ```GET``` and ```POST``` requests to the API I built that stores their game's hi-score data.

[Orbital Defense](https://github.com/dan-collins-dev/orbital-defense)

Built with Godot as a proof of concept on how to use the above mentioned project.
